# NintendoClub

**NintendoClub** is a non-commercial project that I created using **PHP Laravel** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. This website was developed as a personal endeavor separate from my professional work, inspired by my own interests.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Users can publish news items and posts
- **Multilingual Support**: Enables language switching to accommodate a global audience (en, pl, ru)
- **Role-Based Access**: Different user roles for customized access and interaction
- **Notifications**: Alerts users about important events and updates
- **Customizable Profiles**: Showcases personal achievements and integrates with external APIs
- **Online Store and Inventory**: Users can purchase items that are reflected in their inventory and can be used across platforms
- **Login Integration**: Standard login has been disabled in favor of Discord authentication, although standard registration can always be re-enabled if needed

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: PHP with the Laravel framework ensures a robust and scalable application
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS offers a highly customizable user interface
- **APIs**: Extensive use of APIs for real-time interaction with platforms like Telegram and Discord

## Project Management

- **GitHub Upload**: Initially, the project was uploaded to GitHub without branches, as it was a solo project with no need for version control. However, for future updates, the standard practice of using branches for different features and stages of development will be implemented üôè

## Setup

To get the project up and running on your local machine:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `composer install`
